Pong for Lonely People (PFLP) is a game to play when you want to play pong but there is no one else to play pong with and you have no internet so you can't play pong online and you don't have any other versions of pong on your computer.

To run, double-click PFLP.exe.  For further instructions, click the 'About' button.

If you still don't know what's going on email me.

Made in VS2015 using a graphics lbrary by Esmerelda Salamone (esemes@aie.edu.au).
